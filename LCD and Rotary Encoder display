The display modules has two signal connection (and two power connections) which are CLK and DIO. These pins can be connected to any pair of digital pins on the Arduino. When an object is created, the pins should be configured.

Nano pinout with encoder:

Arduino				Encoder-Cable
GND (next to D2)	Black
+5V					Red
D2					Green
D3					White

Arduino				LCD Unit
D4					CLK
D5					DIO
+5V					+5V
